The Local-Language Environment Manager

= Synopsis

  $ lola help                 # Get lola command help
  $ lola js v0.10.24 -g       # Use Node.js v0.10.24 as the global default
  $ lola py 2.5.6             # Use Python 2.5.6 for this shell session
  $ lola pl 5.14.0 .          # Use Perl 5.14.0 under this directory
  $ lola rb 1.9 ~             # Use Ruby 1.9 when run under $HOME
  $ lola show pl              # Show info for Perl5
  $ lola show --all           # Show info for all languages
  $ lola install pl 5.18.1    # Install Perl 5.18.1

= Description

Lola is a generic *Lo*cal *la*nguage environment manager. It lets you:

* Install Bash, Node.js, Perl(5 & 6), Python(2 & 3), Ruby and many more
* Install programming languages locally (per user, under $HOME, no sudo)
* Install multiple runtimes (versions) of each programming language
  * Use fast binary installs where possible
* Switch between language runtimes easily
* Use specific language runtimes, per project (per directory)
* Install packages (gems, modules, libraries) per language/runtime
* Install pkgsets (named sets of packages)
* Switch to specific pkgsets, per project
* Install plugins. Pluggable language and feature support
* Run a single command in a specific environment

In other words, for a given directory (and all directories below it) use
specific runtimes of the programming languages you need, and make specific
packages available to each programming language.

Lola is written for developers, so it not only supports multiple languages,
but also multiple sets of installed packages (libraries, modules, gems, etc).
So, for example, you can test your Ruby code not only against multiple `ruby`
binaries, but also against certain sets of installed gems.  Lola has special
versions of each language's package installer tool, so that packages can be
easily installed into your current environment.

If your project uses more than one language, Lola is the perfect tool for
setting up your test environments. It keeps its settings in directories called
`.lola/`. Each of these contains the current language settings, and the
available package installations, for code run in or below that directory. You
can have many of these directories as you want.

Lola can easily script out test scenarios:

  for v in 1.8 1.9 2.0; do
    for p in A B C; do
      lola run rb=$v@$p ruby test.rb
    done
  done

= Installation

Installing Lola is just getting the Lola source code, putting it somewhere,
and then telling your shell where it is. For example:

  git clone git@github.com:acmeism/lola ~/src/lola

Then simply add the `lib` and `man` directories to your PATH and MANPATH:

  export PATH=/path/to/lola/bin:"$PATH"
  export MANPATH=/path/to/lola/man:"$MANPATH"

All your languages and packages get installed in the directory in the
LOLA_ROOT variable. The default is LOLA_ROOT=~/.lola but you can override it,
by using a startup line like this:

  LOLA_ROOT=/path/lola/root . ~/src/lola/bin/lola-init

Warning: Once you start installing languages, you may not be able to easily
move the LOLA_ROOT directory. This is because many languages build binaries
that are targeted at their install location. See Configuration below.

= Prerequisites

- Bash 3.2 (or higher)

  Lola is written entirely in Bash, and uses `/bin/bash` (since it manages
  local Bash versions too). Modern Bash is 4.2+ but MacOSX still clings to 3.2
  so we use that. Note that although Lola is written in Bash, it still runs
  fine under other shells like `zsh`).

- `build-essential`

  Whatever system tools the various languages require to compile and install
  things. (gcc, make, etc).

  On Debian systems this is provided by the `build-essential` package.

- `curl` or `wget`

  For fetching things from the web.

- `rsync`

  For syncing files.

- `git`

  Used to install Lola and Lola plugins. Also used to read/write config files.

= Plugin Installation

Most of the functionality of Lola comes from Lola plugins. There are a bunch
of plugins that come preinstalled. You can easily find and install new ones
too. Plugins can be enabled, disabled and removed too.

  lola plugin find        # List all known plugins repo urls
  lola plugin add <plugin-git-repo-url>

See Plugin Commands below.

= Upgrading

You can upgrade to the latest versions of Lola and plugins with this command:

  lola upgrade

This is effectively the same as:

  (
    cd $LOLA_SRC
    git pull origin master
    lola update
  )

= Configuration

A Lola setup is based on a few environment variables. The `lola-init` script
used above, sets default values for these (if they are not already set):

- `LOLA_SRC`

  The source code directory for Lola. If you cloned Lola from GitHub, set this
  variable to the path of the `lola` git repo.

- `LOLA_ROOT`

  The directory where all the language specific components live. Since
  languages get built and installed here, it is very likely that if you move
  this directory later, things will not work.

= Commands

Lola strives to have simple, intuitive command usage. Tab completion is fully
suported. Common command terms have alias symbols. You can even use the
`lola-shell` for interactive usage. Or, you can script lola commands with
explicit arguments for readability.

= Command options and arguments

The following options and common arguments apply to many commands:

- `-q` :: Command output should be more quiet.

- `-v` :: Command output should be more verbose.

- `<lid>`

  Language ID. Every supported language has an id (generally 2-4 lowercase
  chars), like `p5` for Perl. There is a default lid which gets set by certain
  commands, and you can always override the value for commands that need a lid.

- `<runtime>`

  This is a tag referring to a specific runtime installation of a specific
  programming language.

- `<pkgset>`

  A named set of installed/available packages.

= Common Commands

- `lola`

  With no arguments, Lola will run `lola shell` by default (configurable).  The
  shell will display useful startup info. Press <ctrl>-d to exit.

- `lola -? | -h`

  Show short help.

- `lola help`

  Show the Lola documentation (manpage).

- `lola <lid>`

  Same as `lola lang <lid>; lola show <lid>`.

- `lola lang <lid>`

  Set the default language-id for commands to use.

- `lola show [<section-id> ...]`

  Show everything about the current Lola environment. Optionally, you can name
  specific sections to report on.

- `lola install <runtime>=[<lid>]`

  Install (fetch code and build locally) a specific runtime of a programming
  language. Remember to use tab completion to see the available options.

- `lola set <lid>=<runtime>[@<pkgset>] [<dir-path>]`

  Use a specific language (and optionally a specific package set). If
  `<dir-path>` is specified, save the settings in that directory, else modify
  the current shell.

== Package Set Commands

You can create, manage and use named sets of installed packages.

- `lola pkg add [<runtime>@]<set-name>`

  Create a new package set for a specific language installation.

== Less Common Commands

- `lola upgrade [ (lola | plugin-name) ...]`

  Upgrade Lola components. You can do everything or just specific components.

- `lola rebuild`

  Make everything in Lola up-to-date internally. Checks your configuration, and
  rebuilds anything necessary, including the shim files.

= Plugin Commands

- `lola plugin`

  List the Lola plugins in use.

- `lola plugin find`

  List the names, descriptions and urls of all known Lola plugins.

- `lola plugin add <lola-plugin-git-repo-url>`

  Add a Lola plugin.

- `lola enable/disable <plugin-name>`

  Enable or disable a given plugin.

- `lola remove <plugin-name>`

  Remove a given plugin altogether.

= Config Commands

- `lola config`

  Show the current Lola configuration.

- `lola config key`

  Show the current setting of a config key.

- `lola config key value`

  Set a config key to a value.

= Prior Art

Lola is heavily inspired by many local language installers that came before it,
including [rbenv], [PerlBrew] and [NVM]. These tools all have their strengths
and weaknesses.

Lola attempts to improve on all of these, and offer the same consistent set of
features to all languages at once. Using the simple plugin system, new
languages can easily be added.
